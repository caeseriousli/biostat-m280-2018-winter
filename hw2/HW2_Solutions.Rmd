## Q1

Read [Chapter 7](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) (Exploratory Data Analysis) of _R for Data Science_ and do exercises 7.3.4, 7.4.1, 7.5.1.1, 7.5.2.1, and 7.5.3.1.

# Exercise 7.3.4
## Number 1

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape)
xyz = melt(data.frame(diamonds$x, diamonds$y, diamonds$z))
ggplot(data = xyz, aes(x = value, y = ..count.., colour = variable)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.1) +
  labs(x = "Measure of the Dimension (mm)", y = "Frequency", 
       title = "Frequency Polygon of Diamond Dimensions") +
  xlim(0, 10)
```
    
    Answer: In order to compare and contrast, I layer the distributions of x, y, and z in the same graph. We can see that dimension x and y have very similar distribution while z has a distribution with shorter measure (in mm) than the other two. Therefore we might infer that x and y might be the length and width of the diamond (which is close to a square or circle). Z is the depth, which tends to be smaller than x and y.
    
## Number 2

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape)

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price, y = ..count..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20) + # binwidth was set to 50, 100, and 200 as well
  labs(x = "Price (Dollars)", y = "Frequency", 
       title = "Frequency Polygon of Diamond Price", 
       subtitle = "Binwidths Set to $100") 
```

    Answer: I plotted price distribution histogram. We can see that the distribution is right-skewed, with most of the diamond pieces priced around $1000. Also note that there is a frequency "gap" at around $1500 - $1600 price range. There aren't many diamond pieces at this price range, compared to its neighboring diamond frequencies. Initially I set the binwidth to 200 and the gap was not visible, because its absence is simply "blended in"" with other bins. Therefore we need to be careful when setting the binwidth. Usually the smaller the better to make the plot smoother.

## Number 3

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape)

a <- diamonds %>% select(carat) %>% filter(carat == 0.99)
b <- diamonds %>% select(carat) %>% filter(carat == 1)
cat(c("Number of diamonds that are 0.99 carat ", nrow(a), "\n"))
cat(c("Number of diamonds that are 1 carat ", nrow(b), "\n"))
```
    Answer: I piped filter() and select() from the dplyr package (select only the relevant column first to make it less tasking for the computer, since we only care about carat). Note that there are only 23 pieces 0.99 cara diamonds but 1558 pieces of 1 carats. There could be many reasons but I might speculate that it is due to the fact that people usually prefer integer(whole) carats (easier to sell). 


## Number 4

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape)

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price, y = ..count..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20) +
  labs(x = "Price (Dollars)", y = "Frequency", 
       title = "Frequency Polygon of Diamond Price", 
       subtitle = "Binwidths Set to $20")+
  xlim(250, 1700) +
  ylim(0, 1500)
  
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price, y = ..count..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Price (Dollars)", y = "Frequency", 
       title = "Frequency Polygon of Diamond Price", 
       subtitle = "No Binwidth Specified") 

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price, y = ..count..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20) +
  labs(x = "Price (Dollars)", y = "Frequency", 
       title = "Frequency Polygon of Diamond Price", 
       subtitle = "Binwidths Set to $20") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(250, 1700), ylim = c(0, 1500), expand = TRUE)
```
    Answer: use number 2 as an example. I first zoomed in using xlim and ylim, with binwidth = 20. As we can see we get a zoomed-in plot with great details in the price range, including the "gap" discussed earlier. In the second plot I did not specify binwidth, and R automatically set the number of bins to 30 and warned me to set up binwidth. 30 bins are too few and we can see that the bins are way too thick for us to see the real distribution. Therefore we should always set a proper binwidth. And lastly, I used coord_cartesian() to zoom in, which basically accomplishes the same thing as ylim and xlim did. However note that when we use coord_cartesian there's no gap on the righthand side of the distribution. The graph continues to the edge of the graph. Therefore coord_cartesian() is a more proper tool for zooming in, as it tells you where the plot gets "cut off".


# Exercise 7.4.1
## Number 1

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape)

a <- diamonds %>% mutate(price = ifelse(price > 15000, NA, price))
ggplot(data = a, aes(x = price, y = ..count..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20) +
  labs(x = "Price (Dollars)", y = "Frequency", 
       title = "Frequency Polygon of Diamond Price", 
       subtitle = "Binwidths Set to $20")

b <- diamonds %>% 
  mutate(cut = replace(cut, seq(1, nrow(diamonds), by = 10), NA))
ggplot(data = b, aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Cut", y = "Count", 
       title = "Bar Plot of Diamonds by Cut", 
       subtitle = "NA Values Added")
```
    Answer: We can see that for histograms, R simply removes all the missing values, with a warning message, "Removed 1655 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin)." However in the bar plot, R gives all NA values a new category and display its frequency in the plot.

## Number 2


## Q2 (optional)

Read [Chapter 23](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html) (Model Basics) and [Chapter 24](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-building.html) (Model Building) of _R for Data Science_ and do exercises 24.2.3 and 24.3.5.

## Q3

Redo HW1 Q2 using tidyverse.

## Q4 (optional)

Redo HW1 Q3 on Hoffman2, except now we want to submit each `runSum.R` job to a different node in the cluster.
