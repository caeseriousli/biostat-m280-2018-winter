## Q1

Read [Chapter 7](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) (Exploratory Data Analysis) of _R for Data Science_ and do exercises 7.3.4, 7.4.1, 7.5.1.1, 7.5.2.1, and 7.5.3.1.

# Exercise 7.3.4
## Number 1

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape)
xyz = melt(data.frame(diamonds$x, diamonds$y, diamonds$z))
ggplot(data = xyz, aes(x = value, y = ..count.., colour = variable)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.1) +
  labs(x = "Measure of the Dimension (mm)", y = "Frequency", 
       title = "Frequency Polygon of Diamond Dimensions") +
  xlim(0, 10)
```
    
    Answer: In order to compare and contrast, I layer the distributions of x, y, and z in the same graph. We can see that dimension x and y have very similar distribution while z has a distribution with shorter measure (in mm) than the other two. Therefore we might infer that x and y might be the length and width of the diamond (which is close to a square or circle). Z is the depth, which tends to be smaller than x and y.
    
## Number 2




## Q2 (optional)

Read [Chapter 23](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html) (Model Basics) and [Chapter 24](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-building.html) (Model Building) of _R for Data Science_ and do exercises 24.2.3 and 24.3.5.

## Q3

Redo HW1 Q2 using tidyverse.

## Q4 (optional)

Redo HW1 Q3 on Hoffman2, except now we want to submit each `runSum.R` job to a different node in the cluster.
