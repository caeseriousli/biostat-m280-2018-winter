# Problem 2

## Part (1)
How many persons are in the data set (statisticians call this n)? How many SNPs are in the data set (statisticians call this p)?   

    Number of persons in this data set is:
    ```{bash}
    awk 'END { print NR }' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.fam
    ```

    Number of SNP's in the data set is:
    ```{bash}
    awk 'END { print NR }' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim
    ```

  

## Part (2) 

### Part A Which chromosomes does this data set contain?   

```{bash}
awk '!seen[$1]++ {print $1}' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim
```

Results:   

1   
3   
5   
7   
9   
11   
13   
15   
17   
19   
21   

From the results we see it contains 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 
  (total of 11) chromosomes

## Part (2) 
### Part B  How many SNPs are in each chromosome?   
```{bash}
awk '{print $1}' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim | sort -n |  uniq -c
```

Results:  

1309299 1   
1215399 3   
1090185 5   
 980944 7   
 732013 9   
 815860 11   
 602809 13   
 491208 15   
 477990 17   
 393615 19   
 239352 21  

number of SNP's are as listed above. Achieved by piping an awk with sort 
  (numerical sorting only the first field), and then pipe a uniq outputting 
  only the unique chromosomes with their repetitions of occurance.    

## Part (3) 
How many SNPs are located within MAP4 gene?    

```{bash}
awk '{ if ( $4 >= 47892180 && $4 <= 48130769 ) print}' 
  /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim | awk 'END { print NR }'
```

Results:   

12423   

Number of SNP's located within MAP4 gene is 12423

```{bash}
awk 'BEGIN { print "    2.40  = FILE FORMAT VERSION NUMBER.\n8348674  = NUMBER OF SNPS LISTED HERE." > "Mendel_SNP" } { print $2 "," $1 "," $4 >> "Mendel_SNP" }' /home/m280-data/hw1/merge-geno.bim
```
